# Momenta — Pre-Generated Enemies

**Version:** 0.31

Momenta is a tactical, cinematic fantasy TTRPG built around modular archetypes and slottable masteries. This catalog contains ready-to-run enemy stat blocks and overlay templates for the **Novice tier** of play. It is intended to be used with the **Momenta Core Rules** (see **Building Encounters** for the challenge-class rules that govern everything below).

All of the catalog examples are a *sample of the design space*, and not to be considered an exhaustive list.



## Enemy Basics

Enemies work differently than player characters in Momenta, with optimizations to speed up gameplay. They have a separate, streamlined **action economy**, and are also scaled across two dimensions - **Challenge Class** and **Tiers of Play**.

> **Design Note:** Authored stat blocks are sovereign; a baseline stat block may natively include Guard, defenses, or other features resembling class-menu abilities regardless of the menu's minimums — the minimum challenge class governs only what a **template** may add.



### Action Economy

Unless otherwise specified in the enemy stat block, the default action economy of an enemy is **1 Move maneuver + 1 extra maneuver**. Enemies **do not track Vigor** and have **no reactions by default**. For the extra maneuvers, enemies are limited to the following maneuver choices:

| Allowed Maneuvers                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Move, Shift, Basic Attack, Shove, Feint, Shake It Off, Any additional stat block-defined abilities or attacks |

Unless otherwise specified, all enemies have a default **Unarmed Attack**, which can either be used to do a **Basic Attack** or a **Shove**.



### Challenge Class

Every enemy stat block will indicate the challenge class of the enemy. There are five challenge classes, in order of deadliness: **Grunt**, **Regular**, **Elite**, **Champion**, **Nemesis**.

Enemy stat blocks in the catalog represent the **baseline stat block**, and most of the enemies will be defined at the Regular challenge class. If you need an enemy of a different challenge class, you can apply one of these **challenge class templates** to a baseline stat block and apply the updated stats to make it into an enemy of a different challenge class.

Note that these templates can only be applied on baseline stat blocks that are designed at the Regular challenge class. Stat blocks that are already designed for higher challenge classes should not apply the templates.

Regular is not a valid template (since the baseline stat blocks should already be at Regular), but it is included in the table below for benchmarking.

|                           | Grunt                     | Regular     | Elite        | Champion     | Nemesis        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Turns / round             | 1                         | 1           | 1            | 2            | 3              |
| Vitality                  | 10 (capped)               | -           | -            | -            | +5             |
| Strain                    | 4 (capped)                | -           | -            | -            | +5             |
| Wound / Burden slots      | none                      | none        | 1 / 1        | 2 / 2        | 3 / 3          |
| Action rolls              | no roll; always 1 success | -           | -            | -            | -              |
| Patterns on action rolls  | no                        | no          | no           | yes          | yes            |
| Auto-clear conditions     | -                         | -           | -            | -            | auto clear all |
| Roll-to-clear conditions  | always fail               | always fail | auto clear 1 | auto clear 1 | auto clear all |
| Persistent conditions     | -                         | -           | -            | -            | -              |
| Challenge class abilities | -                         | -           | 1            | 2            | 4              |

**Special rule:** Grunts are usually fielded in squads. As such, in order to speed up gameplay, up to **4 Grunts may take their turns consecutively** (they are treated as a single turn from the enemy side in the turn order).

**Conditions by challenge class.** Auto-clear conditions behave normally for every class unless the table says otherwise. **Elites and Champions** do not roll to clear: at the end of each of their turns they shed 1 stack of each roll-to-clear condition (and auto-clear conditions shed as normal). A **Nemesis** removes all stacks of every auto-clear and roll-to-clear condition at the end of each of its turns. **Persistent conditions — such as Vulnerable — are never shed this way**; they end only by their own rules. End-of-turn effects (such as Wracked damage) resolve *before* shedding.

**Regulars never clear roll-to-clear conditions on their own.** Hindered, Grabbed, Slowed and the like stick to the rank-and-file until removed by other means (separation, an ally's help, the end of combat). This is deliberate: control is strongest against the many and weakest against the few.



### Tiers of Play

Apply adjustments to each baseline enemy stat block based on the current tier of play:

| Tier of Play | Action Roll Adjustment | Vitality Adjustment | Strain Adjustment | Action Economy Adjustment |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Novice       | -                      | -                   | -                 | -                         |
| Seasoned     | +1d                    | +5                  | +2                | -                         |
| Veteran      | +2d                    | +10                 | +4                | 1 extra maneuver          |
| Paragon      | +3d                    | +15                 | +6                | 2 extra maneuvers         |

| Chosen One            | Nemesis                 | Can **re-roll any luck roll**, but must keep the re-rolled result |



### Enemy Tags

Enemies may have tags that indicate the type of enemy they are. Certain player abilities may have special effects against specific enemy tags. Enemies may have one or more tags.

| Enemy Tags                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Humanoid, Beast, Avian, Aquatic, Undead, Fey, Mindless |



### Hit Locations, Wounds, and Burdens

Unlike player characters, not all enemies will have the standard Mass/Edge/Mark hit locations. Most Humanoid foes will, but some exotic monsters and creatures may not have an Edge, or a Mark, or may have multiples of each. Every creature will define in its stat block the valid hit locations for that particular creature, as well as what happens on a hit to that location (1+ success on a damage dealing attack), or a Wound to that location.

Creatures with no Wound slots (usually Regular enemies) can ignore the Wound Effect hit location column, but it is still included in the stat block just in case the GM wants to apply a challenge class template to the enemy to give it additional Wound slots.

By default, if there is no special Wound Effect listed, then the creature gains the **Impaired N** condition, where N = number of Wound slots now filled (including this Wound). If a Wound Effect is specified, then they suffer the listed effect instead, and does not get the Impaired condition. Enemies never roll on the Wound or Burden consequence tables; they use their listed effects, or the Impaired N default.

Similarly for Burdens, all creatures who receive a Burden will gain the **Impaired N** condition, where N = number of Burden slots now filled (including this Burden). There are no Afflictions for enemies (since enemy behavior is always under the GM control anyway).

**Calling shots.** By default, enemies attack **Mass**. An enemy calls Edge or Mark shots only if its stat block says so, via a **Precise** line in its Tactics / Behavior entry naming which location it favors and when. Grunts never call shots.
